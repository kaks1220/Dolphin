                        In the Pearl River Estuary, the entanglement of fishing nets has actually become one of the most serious threats to the survival of the Chinese white dolphin.

                        Serious cases may be trapped underwater and suffocate to death, most of which are entangled after escaping, or leave scars after breaking free of the rope, which will seriously affect the dolphin's action and predation.

                        Various Marine development activities and increased shipping vessels have squeezed out the living space of the white dolphin to some extent, which is believed to be one of the main reasons for the collapse of the white dolphin population. Since the 1970s, reclamation, port channels, undersea tunnel blasting... Coastal estuary projects have permanently occupied 120 square kilometers of white dolphin habitat in Xiamen Bay. Noise and pollution not only make white dolphins gradually lose their "sense of security", but even become vigilant and evasive.

                        With the development of coastal cities, a large number of coastal development projects, including land reclamation, sand mining, and Marine resource exploitation, have been continuously launched, and the coastal ecological environment has been destroyed, seriously threatening the survival of the Chinese white dolphin and other camel dolphins. Studies have shown that in the past 10 to 20 years, many Chinese white dolphin populations in Chinese waters have experienced a significant population decline, with individual populations declining by nearly 50%.
