                Like to inhabit in the subtropical sea estuary brackish water convergence waters, living in shallow water and rocky places, rest or play will be gathered in the sea near the beach. Their work and rest usually coincide with the time of high tide and sunshine, and they are most active in the morning and evening, often foraging when the tide is high. The food is mainly brackish water fish in estuaries, but also cephalopods, which are eaten quickly without chewing. It usually breeds in spring and summer. After a gestation period of 10-12 months, each litter gives birth to one calf, which is about 100 cm long.

                Dolphins are sea animals that breathe on the surface of the water, and each breath can be maintained under water for twenty or thirty minutes. When people see dolphins at sea jumping out of the water, this is a dolphin breathing. At the same time, dolphins mostly live in shallow waters and rarely swim into the deep sea.

                Dolphins will have different activities in different places, when resting or playing, they will gather in the bay near the beach, and when hunting, they appear in shallow water and rocky places.
