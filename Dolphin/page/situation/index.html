            <p class="main-cont-desc">
                The fate of the Chinese white dolphin, the mascot of Hong Kong's return to China, has been worrying for 20 years: due to water pollution, heavy sea traffic, and some large-scale infrastructure projects in recent years, the number of white dolphins has plummeted from 188 in 2003 to 47 in 2017. Their fertility is also greatly reduced, with researchers finding that only one baby dolphin was born in Hong Kong waters each year in 2016-2017. "Humans often say that they are the soul of all creatures, but we must not be superior because of this. We all need to learn how to respect and coexist with other creatures."

                Due to their scarcity, the Chinese white dolphin is called the "giant panda of the sea". It is the only national Class I protected animal in the dolphin family and is assessed as "vulnerable" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.
