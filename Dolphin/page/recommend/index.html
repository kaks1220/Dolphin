            <p class="main-cont-desc">Chinese white dolphins can be found in western water of Hong Kong and the adjacent Pearl River Estuary. The Chinese white dolphin's diet consists of small fish. Sometimes, we can see them feed behind fishing boats. Many types of surface activities have been observed, including leaping and spy-hoping. Their dive durations are short and do not last more than 4 to 5 minutes in general.</p>
